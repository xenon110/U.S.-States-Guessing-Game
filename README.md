# U.S.-States-Guessing-Game
This project is an interactive U.S. States guessing game built using Python's turtle module and a dataset of U.S. states. The goal of the game is to guess the names of all 50 U.S. states, and as you guess correctly, the state names are displayed on a map at their corresponding coordinates.
